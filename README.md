Practical test
Write a script in laravel to implement basic features of Laravel queue (https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/queues) functionality

1  need page from where jobs are pushed to the queue.
2. need worker which processes the jobs
3. can able to run multiple workers to process jobs and make sure workers are not processing the same jobs.

NOTES :
-- do not use code or database from existing laravel queue library, you need to implement similar in laravel.
-- no need to implement all features, only basic features required to process queue and handle failed jobs.
